Get the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We don't have a release yet (we're unit testing the new database repository framework), so to get the code, clone us::

    git clone git://github.com/sillydeveloper/ploof.git

Models and ORM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Clone the code then initialize ploof for a first run::

    ./ploof install
    
- Edit config/config.application.php to connect to your database. We have several plugins available and are looking to add more.
    
- ploof is set up to automatically build your model files based on your database, wiring in all the relationships for you. So create a simple migration by running::

    ./ploof migration
    
- Open resource/migrations/trunk/1__Migration and add this (for mysql)::

    create table User(id int not null primary key auto_increment, username varchar(255), password varchar(255));
    create table Post(id int not null primary key auto_increment, User_id int, title varchar(255), body text);
            
- Update your database via::

    ./ploof migrate
    
- Now we can generate our models::

    ./ploof generate_models
    
You should have User and Post objects available in the model folder. You can use them to do some associative things right out of the box::

    $new_user= new User();
    $new_user->username= 'foovius';
    $new_user->store();
    $u= User::find_object(array('username'=>'foovius'));
    $p= new Post();
    $p->title= 'Why hello there';
    $u->Post->add_object($p);
    $all_foovius_posts= $u->Post->find();

Controllers and Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's create a controller. Create a new file called Posts.php in the controller folder with::

    <?
        class Posts extends ApplicationController
        {
            function save()
            {
                $post= new Post();
                $post->populate_from($_REQUEST);
                $post->store();
            }

            function index()
            {
                $this->assign('posts', Post::find());
            }
            
            static function classname()
            {
                return __CLASS__;
            }
        }
    ?>

In the views folder, create a folder called Posts and add a file index.html to it::

    Welcome to posts index!
    <?=core\Form::start('/Posts/save')?>
        Make a new post: <?=core\Form::text(new Post(), 'title')?> <input type='submit'/>
    </form>
    <div>
        <? foreach($posts as $post) { ?><div><?=$post->title?></div><? } ?>
    </div>

Server Setup 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ok, but how do I test it? Point your favorite webserver to the public folder, and turn on rewrites with the following (apache style)::

    RewriteRule   ^/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/?$ /index.php?controller=$1&action=$2 [L,QSA]                          
    RewriteRule   ^/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)?$ /index.php?controller=$1&action=$2&id=$3 [L,QSA]
    RewriteRule   ^/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)?$ /index.php?parent=$1&parentid=$2&controller=$3&action=$4 [L,QSA]
    RewriteRule   ^/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)?$ /index.php?parent=$1&parentid=$2&controller=$3&action=$4&id=$5 [L,QSA]
    RewriteRule   ^/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)?$ /index.php?controller=$1&action=$2&id=$3&subcontroller=$4&subaction=$5&subid=$6 [L,QSA]
    RewriteRule   ^/([\_A-Za-z0-9-]+)/?$ /index.php?controller=$1 [L,QSA]
    
You should now be able to point your browser at::

    http://[domain]/Posts

Change the Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In view/layout/default.html you can redesign your layout for each page. 

Testing, Testing, Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run our framework testing via::

    ./ploof test framework
